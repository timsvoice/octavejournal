After years of hard work and dedication by all at Octave, we are excited to introduce Octave’s first product: the pilot project, the Living Room by Octave.

##Thoughts from the Founders
“In a life of continuous change, learning is our most vital skill. By learning life, you empower yourself to be your possibilities.” - Frederick Chavalit Tsao

[quote from Calvin]

##What is Octave
Octave is a learning life company promoting whole person, whole life development. We offer programs for personal growth that lead to individuals and families evolving to their best, most capable and joyful selves.

##Whole Person
To evolve one’s whole spectrum of relating, intuition and ability to gain insight into any life situation, Octave focuses deeply on the whole person. All of our activities integrate four interdependent pillars of human wellness and wellbeing—the need to nurture within; practice mind-body-spirit integration; connect with others in meaningful ways; and discover mindfulness awareness. This approach fosters enhanced self-awareness and promotes for the strengthening of life-and-love affirming relationships - cultural, familial and societal.

##Whole Life
Mindful that each individual's life journey has many stages and junctures, Octave endeavors to serve as a loyal journey mate, steadfastly supporting individuals throughout their lives. Our urban learning centers provide the setting for daily life practice; we offer exurban retreats for highly focused individual and group practice; eco-therapy pilgrimages promote deep, personal nature-based work; and our alternative medical clinics provide a range of wellness evaluation and treatment as part the comprehensive Octave whole life experience.

##We Are on Our Way
The Living Room is our initial project exemplifying Octave’s vision. As it gradually opens up petal by petal like a flower, we are soft launching with events that bring like-minded individuals and groups to our Living Room - sharing what Octave can provide to them when it comes to personal growth that lead to individuals and families evolving to their best, most capable and joyful selves.

##Congratulations All Round
As we continue to move forward, I want to deeply thank all at Octave that helped to make this happen. Let’s move forward together on our journey.
