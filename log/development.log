DEPRECATION WARNING on line 275 of /Users/timsvoice/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.0.0-p576/gems/foundation-rails-5.5.0.0/vendor/assets/stylesheets/foundation/components/_global.scss:
Assigning to global variable "$default-float" by default is deprecated.
In future versions of Sass, this will create a new local variable.
If you want to assign to the global variable, use "$default-float: left !global" instead.
Note that this will be incompatible with Sass 3.2.


DEPRECATION WARNING on line 276 of /Users/timsvoice/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.0.0-p576/gems/foundation-rails-5.5.0.0/vendor/assets/stylesheets/foundation/components/_global.scss:
Assigning to global variable "$opposite-direction" by default is deprecated.
In future versions of Sass, this will create a new local variable.
If you want to assign to the global variable, use "$opposite-direction: right !global" instead.
Note that this will be incompatible with Sass 3.2.


DEPRECATION WARNING: The return value of index() will change from "false" to
"null" in future versions of Sass. For compatibility, avoid using "== false" on
the return value. For example, instead of "@if index(...) == false", just write
"@if not index(...)".
