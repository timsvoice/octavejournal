DEPRECATION WARNING on line 275 of /Users/timsvoice/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.0.0-p576/gems/foundation-rails-5.5.0.0/vendor/assets/stylesheets/foundation/components/_global.scss:
Assigning to global variable "$default-float" by default is deprecated.
In future versions of Sass, this will create a new local variable.
If you want to assign to the global variable, use "$default-float: left !global" instead.
Note that this will be incompatible with Sass 3.2.


DEPRECATION WARNING on line 276 of /Users/timsvoice/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.0.0-p576/gems/foundation-rails-5.5.0.0/vendor/assets/stylesheets/foundation/components/_global.scss:
Assigning to global variable "$opposite-direction" by default is deprecated.
In future versions of Sass, this will create a new local variable.
If you want to assign to the global variable, use "$opposite-direction: right !global" instead.
Note that this will be incompatible with Sass 3.2.


DEPRECATION WARNING: The return value of index() will change from "false" to
"null" in future versions of Sass. For compatibility, avoid using "== false" on
the return value. For example, instead of "@if index(...) == false", just write
"@if not index(...)".

They included: &lsquo;Working with Asian Chinese Families&rsquo; led by Dr. Wai Yung Lee, Clinical Director of the Aitia Family Institute; &lsquo;Publication about Family Therapy and Family Science: An International Perspective&rsquo; presented by Dr. Jay Lebow, Editor-in-Chief of Family Process; and &#39;The Healing of a Couple in Distress&#39; presented by Dr. Evan Imber-Black, Professor and Program Director of the Marriage and Family Therapy Master&#39;s Program at Mercy College, Dobbs Ferry, New York. Aitia Family Institute is the brainchild of its founder Chairman Frederick Chavalit Tsao. His vision is to establish a center of excellence through its leadership in practice, research and training on family dynamics and human relationships. Based on the need in the region, AFI will implement specialized projects to fill the gaps in the existing service provisions and promote new knowledge in selected areas for research.

DEPRECATION WARNING on line 275 of /Users/timothyvoice/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.2.0/gems/foundation-rails-5.5.0.0/vendor/assets/stylesheets/foundation/components/_global.scss:
Assigning to global variable "$default-float" by default is deprecated.
In future versions of Sass, this will create a new local variable.
If you want to assign to the global variable, use "$default-float: left !global" instead.
Note that this will be incompatible with Sass 3.2.


DEPRECATION WARNING on line 276 of /Users/timothyvoice/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.2.0/gems/foundation-rails-5.5.0.0/vendor/assets/stylesheets/foundation/components/_global.scss:
Assigning to global variable "$opposite-direction" by default is deprecated.
In future versions of Sass, this will create a new local variable.
If you want to assign to the global variable, use "$opposite-direction: right !global" instead.
